Star Trek: Discovery is an American web television series created for CBS All Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman. Launched in 2017, it is the first scripted series developed specifically for that service. The seventh series in the Star Trek franchise, it was the first series in the franchise since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005. Star Trek: Discovery begins roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series, and follows the crew of the USS Discovery on various adventures.

Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Michael Burnham, a female science specialist on the Discovery. Doug Jones, Shazad Latif, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, and Wilson Cruz also star, along with Jason Isaacs for the first season, Anson Mount for the second, and David Ajala for the third. The series was announced in November 2015, with Fuller acting as showrunner from February to October 2016 but leaving due to creative differences with CBS. He was replaced by Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, who received producing support from Akiva Goldsman. Goldsman did not return after the first season, while Berg and Harberts were fired by CBS during production on the second; Kurtzman took over as showrunner, and was joined by Michelle Paradise for the third season.

Star Trek: Discovery premiered on September 19, 2017, at ArcLight Hollywood, before debuting on CBS and CBS All Access on September 24. The rest of the 15-episode first season was streamed weekly on All Access, ending in February 2018. The season's release led to record subscriptions for All Access, and positive reviews from critics who highlighted Martin-Green's performance. The 14-episode second season was released from January to April 2019, and the 13-episode third season is expected to debut in 2020.

The series was the beginning of a wider expansion of the Star Trek franchise by CBS and Kurtzman, leading to multiple other series being produced, including the direct spin-off companion series Star Trek: Short Treks.


Premise
Beginning roughly ten years before the events of Star Trek: The Original Series,[2] the show sees the Klingon houses become united in a war with the United Federation of Planets that heavily involves the crew of the USS Discovery (NCC-1031).[3][4] In the second season, after the war has ended, Discovery investigates seven mysterious signals and a strange figure known as the "Red Angel".[5] This conflict ends with the Discovery travelling to the 32nd century, more than 900 years into their future.[6]

Cast and characters
Main article: List of Star Trek: Discovery characters
Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham:
A science specialist on USS Discovery. Burnham is a human who was raised following Vulcan culture and traditions by Sarek.[7][8] A protagonist who is not a starship captain was chosen for the series to give it a different perspective from previous installments in the franchise, with a "richer context" due to her relationships with her captain and her subordinates.[2] Co-creator Bryan Fuller gave her a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads on three of his previous series.[9]
Doug Jones as Saru:
First officer of the USS Discovery.[10] Saru is the first Kelpien to enter Starfleet. Kelpiens, a new species created for Discovery, were hunted as prey on their home planet and thus evolved the ability to sense the coming of danger, giving them a reputation for cowardice.[11] Jones based Saru's walk on that of a supermodel,[8] out of necessity due to the boots he had to wear to portray the character's hooved feet.[12] The producers compared Saru to the characters Spock and Data from previous series.[11]
Shazad Latif as Voq / Ash Tyler:
Voq, an albino Klingon, undergoes extensive surgery to pose as the human Ash Tyler, who becomes chief of security for Discovery.[13][14] Voq was credited as being portrayed by "Javid Iqbal", an invented actor named for Latif's father, to hide the connection between the characters.[13] Latif described his character as "complex and painful",[14] and noted that he has a relationship with Burnham.[15] Voq's accent is Arabic-inspired, and Latif tried to maintain "a kind of pharyngealness" to Tyler's American accent.[13] For the second season, Latif felt that he was playing a third character that melded Voq and Tyler, comparing this relationship to that of Bruce Banner and the Hulk in Marvel Comics.[16]
Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets:
Chief engineer aboard Discovery and a science officer specializing in astromycology (the study of fungi in space) whose research led to the development of Discovery's experimental organic propulsion system.[10][17][18] The character is inspired by a real-life mycologist of the same name.[19] He is the first openly gay character in a Star Trek series. Rapp acknowledged that Hikaru Sulu was portrayed as gay in the film Star Trek Beyond (2016), calling that "a nice nod", but said the series would actually explore Stamets and his partner "in conversation, in our living quarters; you get to see our relationship over time, treated as any other relationship would be treated".[20]
Mary Wiseman as Sylvia Tilly:
A cadet assigned to Discovery.[21][22] She works under Stamets and is Burnham's roommate.[22] The character represents people at the bottom of the Starfleet hierarchy. Season one showrunner Aaron Harberts descirbed her as optimistic and "sort of the soul of our show."[23]
Jason Isaacs as Gabriel Lorca:
Captain of the Discovery,[24] a "brilliant military tactician".[25] Isaacs described the character as "probably more fucked up than any of" the previously seen Star Trek captains.[8] He plays the character with a slight southern U.S. accent, and had initially wanted to ad-lib a catchphrase for the character, feeling that all Star Trek captains should have one, coming up with "git'r done" which the writers turned down due to it being widely used and trademarked by Larry the Cable Guy.[26]
Wilson Cruz as Hugh Culber:
Medical officer aboard Discovery and Stamets's husband.[27] Cruz said portraying the first openly gay couple in Star Trek was "a long time coming" and praised the way the series did not go out of its way to focus on their relationship.[28] The character is killed in the first season, but Culber returns from the dead in the second season in a larger role.[29]
Anson Mount as Christopher Pike:
Captain of the Enterprise who takes temporary command of the Discovery.[30] The character was first portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in "The Cage".[31] Mount described Pike as "very by-the-book, usually, and a good person", while executive producers Heather Kadin and Alex Kurtzman described him as being the opposite of Lorca with a "very captain-like" presence and "enough confidence and authority to apologize when he is wrong".[32] Mount did not try to imitate Hunter's performance.[30]
David Ajala as Cleveland "Book" Booker[33]

Development
Announcement
On November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, "on the heels" of the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Original Series in 2016. This was the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005, and the first show to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access streaming service. Alex Kurtzman, co-writer of the films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Heather Kadin were set as executive producers on the series, which would not be related to the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond.[34][35] The January 2017 date was the earliest that CBS could release a new Star Trek series after an agreement the company made when it split from Viacom in 2005.[36] Showtime, Netflix, and Amazon Video all offered "a lot of money" for the rights to release the series,[37] but after heavily investing in the new All Access service, CBS believed that a returning Star Trek could be "the franchise that really puts All Access on the map".[36][37] In January, CBS president Glenn Geller said the CBS network were not creatively involved in the series, despite plans for the network to broadcast the pilot episode, saying, "It really is for All Access."[38]

Bryan Fuller
After beginning his career writing for the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, Bryan Fuller was announced as the new series' showrunner and co-creator alongside Kurtzman in February 2016.[39][40] Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), also joined the series as a consulting producer.[41] In March, Rod Roddenberry (the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry) and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series as executive producers.[42] Fuller said that working with people previously involved with Star Trek was "really about making sure that we maintain authenticity", and said that Meyer—who is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khan—brings "a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling."[43]

Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years, particularly because of its impact on minority groups, as he explained, "I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship. I couldn't stop thinking about how many Asian people were inspired by seeing George Takei and feeling that gave them hope for their place in the future. I wanted to be part of that representation for a new era."[44] When Fuller first met with CBS about the series, the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be.[45] He proposed an anthology series, with each season being a standalone, serialized story set in a different era. This would begin with a prequel to The Original Series, followed by stories set during The Original Series, during Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then "beyond to a time in Trek that's never been seen before". Fuller compared this to what American Horror Story did for horror, and described the proposal as a platform for "a universe of Trek shows". CBS instead suggested he create a single serialized show to see how that performed first, and Fuller began further developing the concept of a prequel to The Original Series.[44]

Fuller announced in June 2016 that the first season would consist of 13 episodes,[45] though he would prefer to produce 10 episodes a season moving forward.[46] A month later, Fuller announced the series' title to be Star Trek: Discovery,[47] and revealed that it would be set in the "Prime Timeline" (which includes the previous Star Trek series, but not the modern reboot films) to keep the concurrent series and films separate, so "we don't have to track anything [happening in the films] and they don't have to track what we're doing".[48][46] Also in July, CBS Studios International licensed the series to Netflix for release outside the United States and Canada,[40] a "blockbuster" deal that paid for the show's entire budget (around US$6–7 million per episode).[49][50] During pre-production on the series, Fuller and CBS had further disagreements on the direction of the show. The production was starting to overrun its per-episode budget, and was falling behind schedule due to Fuller supervising all aspects of the series while also serving as showrunner on another new show, American Gods. This caused frustration among CBS executives who felt Fuller should be focused on having Discovery ready for release by the January 2017 premiere date.[44]

By August 2016, Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, whom he had worked with on Pushing Daisies, to serve as co-showrunners with him.[46][50] A month later, he and Kurtzman asked CBS to delay the series' release so they could meet the high expectations for it, and the studio pushed the series premiere back to May 2017."[51] At the end of October, CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner,[44] and announced a restructuring of the production: Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners, working from a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller; Kurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers, but with Fuller moving his attention fully to American Gods; and Akiva Goldsman would join the series in a supporting producer role, similar to the role he held on Fringe alongside Kurtzman. CBS reiterated that they were "extremely happy with [Fuller's] creative direction" for the series,[50] though some elements of the series that came directly from Fuller were dropped, including some designs and "more heavily allegorical and complex story" points.[44] Fuller later confirmed that he was no longer involved with the series, but expressed interest in returning for future seasons if he was asked.[52]

Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts
With production set to finally begin on the series in January 2017, "a lot of careful deliberation [was] continuing to go into making Discovery special, from the choice of directors, to set design, to the special effects."[53] Ted Sullivan joined the series to serve as supervising writing producer.[54][55] At CBS's 2017 upfront presentation, CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise confirmed a "fall" release date for the series, and announced that the episode order had been expanded to 15 episodes.[56][57] In June, CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, with the season airing through November 2017, and then beginning again in January 2018. This break gave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the season.[58] Also that month, Kurtzman said that he and Fuller had discussed future seasons before the latter's departure, and promised that "what's there in terms of story and certainly in terms of set-up, character, big ideas, the big movement of the season, that's all stuff that Bryan and I talked about" and would not be altered.[59] Goldsman said in August that future seasons would have "a hybridized [anthology] approach" with "arcs which will have characters that we know and characters that we don't know."[9] Kurtzman added that the success of Discovery could lead to other new Star Trek series that could potentially use the anthology format.[60]

By the end of August, Berg and Harberts had developed a "road map" for a second season, and "the beginnings of one" for a third. It was also revealed that an average episode of the first season had ultimately cost US$8–8.5 million each, making it one of the most expensive television series ever created. This exceeded the original Netflix deal, but CBS still considered the series paid for due to the number of new All Access subscribers that it was expected to draw.[61] After the series' premiere, Kurtzman said the producers wanted to avoid announcing release dates for any future seasons, due to the external pressure that having to delay them caused with the first season. Despite this, he hoped a second season would be available in early 2019.[62] The second season was officially ordered in October 2017,[63] consisting of 13 episodes.[64] Goldsman did not return for the season after clashing with the series' writing staff during production on the first,[65] while Meyer was not asked to return for the second season.[66] In June 2018, when production on the second season was underway, CBS fired Berg and Harberts. This was due to the first episode of the season going significantly over budget, and alleged abusive behavior by the pair directed at the series' writing staff. Kurtzman was made sole showrunner, and was set to "regroup" the writers without causing any delay to the season's production timeline.[65]

Alex Kurtzman and Michelle Paradise
After Kurtzman took over, the second season was confirmed to be on track for a January 2019 premiere,[67] though there ultimately was enough of a delay in production that CBS extended the season's episode count to 14 as a way to amortize the cost of the delays.[68] Shortly after the season premiere, in February, the series was renewed for a third season with writer Michelle Paradise promoted to co-showrunner alongside Kurtzman.[69] In October, Kurtzman said the season would consist of 13 episodes.[70]

Writing
"The defining factor of Roddenberry's vision is the optimistic view of the future ... Once you lose that, you lose the essence of what Star Trek is. That being said... Star Trek has always [reflected the time it was made, and now the question] is how do you preserve and protect what Starfleet is in the weight of a challenge like war and the things that have to be done in war."
—Executive producer Alex Kurtzman on the balance between classic Star Trek and new elements in Discovery[71]
The series' writers room is based at Kurtzman's Secret Hideout offices in Santa Monica,[72] and includes "fans who all have very different relationships to Trek," which Kurtzman said is "a healthy thing".[59] Fuller wanted to differentiate the series from the previous 700+ episodes of Star Trek by taking advantage of the streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the entire first season. He and Kurtzman developed this story from the "DNA" of certain The Original Series episodes to find "the spirit of what Star Trek offers, both in terms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful metaphors for the human condition".[45] Berg said that the series' writers "are so in love with" The Original Series, The Next Generation, and the family aspect of those series, while Harberts added that Meyer's Star Trek films were an especial influence on Discovery because "his storytelling is complex and intellectual and yet there's a lot of room for character voices".[73]

The titular ship was named after Discovery One from 2001: A Space Odyssey, NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery, and "the sense of discovery ... what [that] means to Star Trek audiences who have been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a planet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and collaborate with".[74] Fuller saw the series as a bridge between Enterprise and The Original Series—which are set around 150 years apart—but set much closer to the latter to allow the series to "play with all the iconography of those ships and those uniforms".[75] In May 2017, Sullivan described the series as "a genuine prequel" to The Original Series,[76] with Goldsman later adding that there were many classic Star Trek elements that fans among the writers wished to include in the series, but couldn't because they were included in The Original Series as something being discovered by Starfleet for the first time then.[77] The choice to feature a single serialized story throughout the first season was inspired by the general change in television to tell more realistic and serialized stories rather than the "new destination-based adventure each week" format mostly used in previous Star Trek series. Fuller had been one of several writers during the 1990s pushing for Deep Space Nine and Voyager to move towards this style.[78] Also inspired by modern, "peak television" series such as Game of Thrones was a willingness to kill off major characters for dramatic reasons, though the writers wanted to avoid doing so gratuitously or for "shock value".[79]

Fuller said the series could "push the content envelope since it won't be constrained by broadcast standards", but "it's still Star Trek. It will probably be slightly more graphic content ... I imagine we're going to shoot scenes a couple of ways and see what feels more authentic in the editing room."[2] Harberts ultimately described the series as a "hard PG-13", saying the series could include "some violent things or [a] tiny bit of language" but they still wanted the show to be for families and to "honor what the franchise is."[80] On using time travel in the series, a plot device used in at least two episodes of every previous live-action Star Trek season, Fuller said that it had not yet been used for any episode by the end of August 2016, and, "You never know when you want to pull out that device but I am not anticipating an over-reliance on time travel to tell this season's stories."[46] The series' writers also chose to ignore Gene Roddenberry's longstanding rule that Starfleet crew members not have any significant conflict with one another or be depicted negatively (a rule that Roddenberry himself did not always strictly follow). Harberts explained, "We're trying to do stories that are complicated, with characters with strong points of view and strong passions. People have to make mistakes—mistakes are still going to be made in the future. We're still going to argue in the future ... the thing we're taking from Roddenberry is how we solve those conflicts."[78] Because of the show's position as a prequel to The Original Series, the producers felt it was more important for Discovery to build towards Roddenberry's ideals, and to show that "you can't simply be accepting and tolerant without working for it, and so this show is about that struggle."
