Productive day here studying git, vi, and emacs at the same time. 
This folder, is an example of the practice I'm going through to use all three.
Many might think I'm crazying mixing emacs and vi, truth is I don't like vi as much.
However, there are a few functions I like such as the backspace not deleting but 
literally being a backspace! Then the overwriting happens. 
Also, I like how some of the keys are the same as on the terminal like ctrl a and e.
