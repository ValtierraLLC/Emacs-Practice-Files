# Emacs-Practice-Files

Just examples of what I ask students to do when they first start to learn Emacs.
Step 1: Learning the move around keys
c-v move forward one screenful, m-v back a screen
c-f / c-b forward and backward one letter, I do NOT like these b/c they are not like the shortcuts on terminal
c-a / c-e jump to beginning or end of line, I DO like these b/c they are like the terminal

c-p / c-n up and down one line. I DO like these b/c they just feel natural, maybe b/c I've used them so much. 
Or because previous and next just makes sense

m-f / m-b move forward/backward a word, I LOVE these b/c terminal is same. 

The last command is all about deleting/killing and I want students to edit large blocks of text using these commands.
Texts to edit could be RFCs, Wikipedia articles, whatever their hearts desire!
